# Changelog
All future changes from this point on will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2018-04-05
### Changed
- Functionalized the entire script so that every git installation is in its own function. I did this to help the user specify which packages won't be installed by simply commenting out a function call at the bottom of the script.

## [1.0.4] - 2018-04-02
### Added
- This changelog
- Whonow DNS Server from [@brannondorsey](https://github.com/brannondorsey)
- Burp vulners plugin from [@vulnersCom](https://github.com/vulnersCom)
- dotdotslash from [@jcesarstef](https://github.com/jcesarstef)

### Changed
- The Empire section was not actually installing Empire if the user selected "Yes". Added a couple of lines to fix it.
